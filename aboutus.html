    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>Ride Sweetly is an <strong>app for cyclists</strong> that wants to offer the best outfit (jersey, bibs, gloves...) before you go out for a cycling ride.</p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Through the map, <strong>you can search and add all the interesting key locations</strong> of your ride. When you think you have enough points, <strong>click and get the best option for you and your ride according to the weather forecasting</strong>.</p>
    <p>Basically, Ride Sweetly will get the weather forecasting of each location you add and it will search, inside your personal inventory of cycling clothes, which pieces are best suited (always related with weather forecasting).</p>
